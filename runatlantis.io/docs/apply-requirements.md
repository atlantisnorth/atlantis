# Apply Requirements

## Approved
If you'd like to require pull/merge requests to be approved prior to a user running `atlantis apply` simply run Atlantis with the `--require-approval` flag.
By default, no approval is required. If you want to configure this on a per-repo/project basis, for example to only require approvals for your production
configuration you must use an `atlantis.yaml` file:
```yaml
version: 2
projects:
- dir: .
  apply_requirements: [approved]
```

::: danger
A pull request approval might not be as secure as you'd expect:
* In GitHub **any user with read permissions** to the repo can approve a pull request.
* In GitLab, you [can set](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html#editing-approvals) who is allowed to approve.
:::

::: tip Note
In Bitbucket Cloud (bitbucket.org), a user can approve their own pull request.
Atlantis does not count that as an approval and requires at least one user that
is not the author of the pull request to approve it.
