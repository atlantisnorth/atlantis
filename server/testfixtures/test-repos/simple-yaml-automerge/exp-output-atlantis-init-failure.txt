### 3. dir: `failing-init` workspace: `default`
**Plan Error**
```
exit status 1: running "terraform init -input=false -no-color" in "/dataDir/repos/runatlantis/atlantis-tests/2/default/failing-init"
preinit

There are some problems with the configuration, described below.

The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

Error: Error loading /dataDir/repos/runatlantis/atlantis-tests/2/default/failing-init/main.tf: position 1:10: resource must be followed by exactly two strings, a type and a name
